⚠️ Android Trace only supports Android

Android Trace provides access to the Android NDK methods, such as `ATrace_beginSection` and `ATrace_endSection`.
This enables using [Android GPU Inspector](https://gpuinspector.dev/) for Rust code.

<!-- We use the link to the crate page because of crates.io and docs.rs.
If you're reading this comment, you probably want the tracing_android_trace which is
a sibling to this file's parent folder-->
See [tracing_android_trace](https://crates.io/crates/tracing_android_trace)
for an integration of this with [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/).

## Quickstart

Add a dependency on Android Trace:

```toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
android_trace = "0.1.0"
```

The main entry point to the library is [AndroidTrace][], which stores function pointers to each available NDK function:

```rust,no_run
use android_trace::AndroidTrace;
let trace = AndroidTrace::new();

// If the `is_enabled` method isn't available, we also shouldn't trace
let should_trace = trace.is_enabled().unwrap_or(false);
if should_trace {
  trace.begin_section(c"My expensive calculation");
}

// ...performing an expensive calculation

if should_trace {
  trace.end_section();
}
```

## Android API levels

The first level of the [tracing API](https://developer.android.com/ndk/reference/group/tracing) has been available since Android API level 23, and a more flexible API was added in Android API level 29.
To support devices with any Android API versions, we resolve these functions at runtime using [dlsym][].
This runtime access is used unless we know (through [features](#crate-feature-flags)) that a certain API level is available.

## Crate feature flags

The following feature flags are available:

* `api_level_23` (enabled by default): Require Android API level 23, to avoid some runtime symbol resolution
* `api_level_29`: Require Android API level 29, to improve efficiency, to avoid runtime symbol resolution entirely

To support Android API versions less than 23, you should disable default features:

```toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "android")'.dependencies]
android_trace = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false }
```

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Android Trace has been verified to compile with Rust 1.77 and later.

Future versions of Android Trace might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
